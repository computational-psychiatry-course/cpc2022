# CPC Zurich 2022 Tutorials

The practical tutorial sessions on the Day 6 of the course provide small-group, in-depth and hands-on experience on a specific modelling approach. The tutorials cover only open-source software packages.

## Practical Session A with Tore Erdmann, Alex Hess & Peter Thestrup Waade - Bayesian Learning using the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter (HGF)
#### Description
In this tutorial, we will recap the theory behind the Hierarchical  Gaussian Filter (HGF) and introduce the model in an accessible way. We  will then discuss practical issues when fitting computational models to  behavioral data in general and specific to the HGF. We will work through exercises to learn how to analyze data with the HGF using the HGF  Toolbox (in Julia).

## Practical Session B with Ryan Smith, Rowan Hodson & Christopher Whyte - Active Inference using SPM

#### Description

In this tutorial, we will review the theory behind active inference and  how to implement it within a partially observable Markov decision  process (POMDP). We will then do exercises building generative models of common behavioral tasks, learn how to run simulations, and illustrate  the useful properties of this modeling framework and when it is and  isn't applicable. Finally, we will work through exercises to learn how  to fit active inference models to behavioral data and use parameter  estimates as individual differences measures in common computational  psychiatry contexts. All tutorial exercises will be conducted in MATLAB.

The material for this tutorial can be found in the `tutorial-b` folder.


## Practical Session C with Conor Heins & Ana Grosu - Active Inference using the PYMDP Toolbox
#### Description
This tutorial provides a practical guide on developing computational  models using pymdp, a Python package for solving partially-observed  Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) with Active Inference. Students will  build simple simulations in interactive, cloud-hosted Python notebooks  (Google Colab). We aim to help students build generative models for  POMDPs and to develop a conceptual understanding of the theoretical  principles behind active inference, without requiring detailed technical knowledge.

## Practical Session D with Woo-Young Ahn, Eunhwi Lee & Jeung-Hyun Lee - Reinforcement Learning using the hBayesDM Package
#### Description
In this tutorial, participants will learn how to use a Bayesian package  called hBayesDM (supporting R and Python) for modeling various  reinforcement learning and decision making (RLDM) tasks. A short  overview of (hierarchical) Bayesian modeling will be also provided.  Participants will also learn important steps and issues to check when  reporting modeling results in publications.

## Practical Session E with Ariel Zylberberg & Max Pensack - The Drift-diffusion model of decision-making
#### Description
In this tutorial, students will learn the theory and practice behind the drift-diffusion model, as it is usually applied to explain behavior (choice, response time, confidence) in simple decision-making tasks. Participants will implement computational simulations to study the properties of the drift-diffusion model, and fit experimental data using MATLAB code provided by the instructor. We will also discuss some of the limitations of the model and common mistakes made when interpreting the model parameters.
#### Material
The code for this tutorial can be found in the `tutorial-e` folder (included as submodule).


## Practical Session F with Lionel Rigoux & Matthias Müller-Schrader - Modelling Crash-Course using the VBA Toolbox
#### Description
In this hands-on tutorial, you will apply computational modelling to a real-life example. Starting from a simple experimental design (delay discounting task), you will learn how to:
- choose and implement the right model for your task;
- fit it to empirical data (and get parameter estimates);
- perform hypothesis testing using model selection and
- validate your analysis using simulations and diagnostic tools.

You will also learn the basics of the VBA-toolbox which contains all the tools to simulate, estimate, and diagnose your models, as well as a collection of ready-to-use models (e.g. Q-learning, DCM). No previous experience with modelling is required, but basic knowledge of MATLAB is recommended.

## Practical Session G with Saige Rutherford & Thomas Wolfers - Machine Learning Tutorial using the PCNtoolkit
#### Description
Would you like to learn more about modeling individual differences and  heterogeneity in psychiatry? In this tutorial, we will abandon the  classical patient vs. healthy control framework. You will be guided  through how to run an analysis using normative modeling implemented in  the [PCNtoolkit](https://github.com/amarquand/PCNtoolkit/wiki/Normative-Modelling) (using cloud-hosted Python notebooks in Google Colab).

## Practical Session H with Ashley Tyrer & Herman Galioulline - Dynamic Causal Modelling for EEG using the SPM-DCM Package
#### Description
This tutorial will examine specific features of EEG data that can be  used to optimize a cell and receptor specific model of brain  connectivity. EEG data acquired from an event-related (ERP) visual  memory study will be examined. The assumptions and parametrizations of  the neural mass models will be explained. Students will learn to use the SPM graphical user interface and to write batch code in MATLAB to  perform Dynamic Causal Modeling of EEG.

## Practical Session I with Jakob Heinzle & Birte Toussaint - Dynamic Causal Modelling for fMRI using the SPM-DCM Package
#### Description
In this tutorial you will learn how to use the SPM software to perform a dynamic causal modeling (DCM) analysis in MATLAB. We will first guide you through all steps of a basic DCM analysis of a single subject: Data extraction, Model setup, Model inversion and, finally, inspection of Results. We will then proceed to look at a group of subjects. Here, we will focus on model comparison and inspection of model parameters.
We will provide a point-by-point recipe on how to perform the analysis. However, it is of advantage if you have worked with neuroimaging (fMRI) data and MATLAB before.

## Practical Session J with Marion Rouault & Sandra Iglesias - Modelling metacognition using the hMeta-d Toolbox
#### Description
In this tutorial, we will recap the theory underlying the hMeta-d model for quantifying metacognitive efficiency, our ability to monitor and evaluate our own decisions. We will introduce the model in an accessible way, then discuss practical issues when fitting computational models to behavioral data, and go through code examples relevant to computational psychiatry studies using the hMeta-d toolbox (in MATLAB). 
#### Material
The material for this tutorial can be found in the `tutorial-j` folder.


## Practical Session K with Stefan Frässle & Imre Kertesz - Advanced Models of Connectivity: regression DCM using the Tapas rDCM toolbox
#### Description
In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the regression dynamic causal modeling (rDCM) toolbox to perform effective (directed) connectivity analyses in whole-brain networks. We will provide you with the necessary theoretical background of the rDCM approach and detail practical aspects that are relevant for whole-brain connectivity analyses. After having laid the foundation, a hands-on part will familiarize you with the code and provide in-depth training on how to apply the model to empirical fMRI data. The goal of this tutorial is to familiarize you with the theoretical and practical aspects of rDCM, which will allow you to seamlessly integrate the approach into your own research.
We will provide clear instructions on how to perform the analyses. However, experience with the analysis of fMRI data (already some experience with classical DCM for fMRI would be ideal) as well as experience with MATLAB are beneficial.
