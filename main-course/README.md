# CPC Zurich 2022 - Main Course

The main course takes place over a period of 5 days.

## Course Structure

The **first day** covers topics in **Psychiatry** providing a conceptual basis for the type of questions that Computational Psychiatry needs to address.

The **second day** explains basic **modelling principles** (basic mathematical terminology, step-by-step guide on how to build a  model, model fitting and model selection) and finishes with a first  introduction to models of perception (Psychophysics, Bayesian Models of Perception).

The **third day** continues with **reinforcement learning**, **models of perception** (Predictive Coding), an introduction to the HGF (hierarchical gaussian filter), **action selection** (Markov Decision Processes, Active Inference, Drift Diffusion Models) and ends with an introduction to models of metacognition.

The **fourth day** includes **models of brain connectivity** (Dynamic Causal Modeling for fMRI and EEG and biophysical network models) and **Machine Learning** (basics and advanced). 

 The **fifth day** features a series of talks on practical **applications** of computational models to problems from Psychiatry.

 The detailed main course schedule can be found on the [CPC Zurich webpage](https://www.translationalneuromodeling.org/cpcourse/).
